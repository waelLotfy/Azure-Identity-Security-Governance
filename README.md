Hands-on exploration of Azure identity, security, and governance fundamentals including Azure Key Vault, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and activity monitoring.

# Azure Identity, Security & Governance — Hands-on Exploration

## Overview
This repository documents hands-on labs focused on Azure identity, security, and governance services completed as part of the AZ-900T00-A course.  
The work explores how Azure secures resources using centralized secret management, role-based access control, and auditing.

---

## Labs Completed
- Create and configure Azure Key Vault
- Store and manage secrets securely
- Assign and manage access using Azure RBAC
- Monitor access changes using Activity Logs

---

## Core Concepts Explored

### Azure Key Vault
- Secure storage for secrets, keys, and certificates
- Centralized secret management
- Improves security and compliance

### Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Controls who can access Azure resources
- Uses predefined roles such as Virtual Machine Contributor
- Enforces least-privilege access

### Monitoring and Auditing
- Activity Logs track access and configuration changes
- Supports governance and compliance requirements

---

## Key Learnings
- Azure Key Vault protects sensitive information outside application code.
- Access to Azure resources is controlled using RBAC.
- Roles define what actions users can perform.
- Azure provides auditing and monitoring for access changes.
- Identity and governance are foundational to cloud security.

---

## Next Steps
- Explore Azure Active Directory and identity management.
- Apply governance policies using Azure Policy.
- Implement security best practices across cloud environments.
